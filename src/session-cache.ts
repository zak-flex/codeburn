// v5: kiro joined the costUSD pass-through allowlist (credit-based pricing).
// Cached kiro entries from v4 carry costUSD: undefined and would keep being
// re-priced from estimated tokens forever, since historical session files
// never change. Bump forces a one-time re-parse so metered credit costs land.
// v6: per-turn `prRefs` capture for turn-level PR spend attribution. Existing
// cache turns carry no prRefs; bumping forces a one-time re-parse so surviving
// transcripts populate the field. (Daily-cache versioning is untouched.)
// v7: sidechain->parent linkage - per-turn `spawnToolUseIds`, per-file
// `parentSessionId` / `agentSpawnLinks` - so subagent spend folds into the parent
// turn's PR set. v6 never shipped, so users cross v5->v7 in a single combined bump.
// INVARIANT: a version bump must extend `PRIOR_CACHE_VERSIONS` (the adoption path
// below) to EVERY prior version that can still exist on disk, or expired-PR
// history from the immediately preceding build silently vanishes.
// v8: on-disk layout only - the single blob became a directory of per-provider
// shards plus a small envelope, so a launch that only touched one provider
// rewrites just that provider's file. The turn shape is unchanged, so a v7 file
// migrates losslessly (migrateSingleFileCache) rather than re-parsing.
// v9: on-disk layout only - a provider's shard split further by the UTC month of
// each cached file, so one appended session rewrites one month instead of the
// provider's whole (100MB-scale) history, and a ranged query loads only the
// months it can possibly report on. Turn shape unchanged, so v8 and v7 both
// migrate losslessly.
// v10: on-disk layout only - a provider's files are stored in pieces by the UTC
// day of each file's newest call, with a per-provider index of every cached
// file (piece, fingerprint, call span) and a per-piece file of dedup keys. A
// narrow query reads the index, the keys, and only the members it reports on;
// an append rewrites one day. Turn shape unchanged, so v9 migrates losslessly.

// it serves the old section silently, reporting nothing from the new root.
// One read in src/providers/ is deliberately absent: CODEBURN_VERBOSE
// (sqlite-session-parser.ts:276) only changes logging verbosity, never parsed
// output.
//
// Copilot is deliberately NOT declared here. Declaring any CODEBURN_COPILOT_*
// var would change its fingerprint, and on a fingerprint change
// getOrCreateProviderSection (src/parser.ts:2650) keeps only the cached
// entries whose source path no longer exists — but copilot's OTel discovery
// returns one source per DB file ({ path: dbPath }, src/providers/copilot.ts:1935)
// and that DB keeps existing, so its cached entry would be dropped and
// re-parsed, destroying conversations Copilot has since pruned from the DB
// that only the cache still holds (see DURABLE_PROVIDER_NAMES below). Do not
// "complete" the map for copilot until the durable carry-forward learns to
// merge instead of drop.
//
// CODEBURN_COPILOT_SESSION_STORE_DB is covered by that ruling too, and needs
// no exception: repointing it cannot serve stale data. Copilot's
// rollup-vs-store reconciliation runs at SERVE time over the cached serve set
// (parseProviderSources), never against a discovery-time snapshot, so a
// repointed path is simply a new source parsed on sight while the old path's
// cached rows persist as durable orphans contributing exactly what they
// always did. There is no cross-file dependency for the fingerprint to catch,
// so declaring it would buy nothing and cost the durable-history loss above.
//
// CODEBURN_WSL (src/wsl.ts) is also deliberately absent, for claude and codex
// alike. It is a live read policy, not parsed content: active roots add paths;
// stopped roots retain historical WSL rows without touching their UNC share;
// and active-root deletions are reconciled explicitly by src/parser.ts.
// `off` disables discovery/UNC access while leaving that retained history
// readable. Hashing the policy here would instead discard the rows that make a
// shutdown/restart cycle lossless and force a full 9P re-parse after re-enable.

 *    so it answers a query starting at or after that floor and no other.
 *
 *  `sinceMs` is the requested range start; omitting it asks about ALL of
 *  history, which only a section with no floor can satisfy. A section with no

// metadata in a companion file (kiro CLI: credits in `<id>.json` next to the
// `.jsonl`; kiro v2: modelId in `session.json` next to `messages.jsonl`) have
// a blind spot: a parse that races the companion write caches the turn with
// fallback values, and if the transcript never changes again (a session's
// final turn) the entry never invalidates. Mid-session turns self-heal since
// append-only transcripts keep changing. Fixing this properly means
// multi-file fingerprints per source.

// SQLite database files by extension. Bare-db sources (copilot's
// agent-traces.db) and the virtual-suffix bases below all match one of these.

/// (hermes, cursor and opencode keep their state DBs open for the life of
/// the agent process) can defer checkpoints for hours or days. A fingerprint
/// built from the main file alone then (a) carries an mtime older than the
/// newest committed data, so the date-range mtime pre-filter in
/// parseProviderSources skips the source and sessions committed after the
/// last checkpoint never parse (issue #913: today's Hermes sessions missing
/// from every report), and (b) does not change between checkpoints, so
/// reconcileFile keeps serving stale cached turns for sessions that grew.
/// Folding the WAL sibling in fixes both: the newest mtime wins, and the
/// sizes add so both WAL growth and a checkpoint (db grows, wal truncates)

//
// `codeburn status --format menubar-json` is spawned as a fresh CLI process
// on every menubar poll tick, so every in-process reuse layer above
// (`cacheMemo`, and `parser.ts`'s TTL/burst maps) starts cold on every poll —
// none of them survive between invocations. Live profiling of a repeat poll
// against an already-warm, unchanged ~386MB session cache showed the cost is
// dominated by re-running `JSON.parse` on that whole file plus re-running the
// full aggregation pipeline over it, every single time, even when nothing in
// the underlying session corpus changed.
//
// This snapshot persists the last computed menubar payload keyed by a
// caller-supplied corpus fingerprint (see `computeCorpusFingerprint` in
// parser.ts — a cheap stat-only pass over every discovered source, with no
// session-cache.json read/parse and no transcript content read) plus the
// resolved query that produced it. A poll whose corpus fingerprint and query
// both still match is served straight from this tiny file with no corpus
// parse or aggregation at all; the instant either changes, the lookup misses
// and the caller recomputes for real. Best-effort throughout: any read/write
// failure just falls back to a full recompute, never to stale or corrupt
// data.

// Debounce: once the corpus fingerprint moves, keep serving the last SETTLED
// snapshot until this record's first observed mismatch has aged past the
// window, instead of recomputing on every single poll of a burst. A streaming
// assistant turn
// can touch its transcript many times a second; without this, a menubar
// polling on a tight interval would pay the full parse+aggregation cost on
// every one of those ticks. The deferred call deliberately does NOT persist
// a new snapshot — the pre-churn baseline it's still serving stays on disk —
// so the first poll after the mismatch clock ages past the window sees a real
// fingerprint mismatch with no fresh grace period left,
// recomputes for real, and persists the settled result. No update is ever
// masked permanently: the window only ever delays picking one up. Mirrors

/** Best-effort: a failed write just means the next poll recomputes instead

 *  there before — UNLESS a concurrent recompute already published one based
 *  on a strictly fresher corpus observation (`observedAtMs`), in which case
 *  this (slower, now-stale) write is refused rather than clobbering it. Ties
 *  proceed: both reflect a correct recompute of the same corpus state. Always
 *  writes a fresh record with no `mismatchFirstSeenAt`, which is exactly what
